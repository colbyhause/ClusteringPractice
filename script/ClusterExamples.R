# determing optimal K- which means the number of groups you wantto cluster:
# create the function that runs the k-mean algorithm and store the total within clusters sum of squares:

  return (cluster$tot.withinss) # Store the total within clusters sum of squares

}

# trying just 2 times:

# use the sapply() function to run the algorithm over a range of k. 
# This technique is faster than creating a loop and store the value:
# Set maximum cluster 
max_k <-20
# Run algorithm over a range of k 
wss <- sapply(2:max_k, kmean_withinss) # run function over range of 2- 20

# dataframe to work with:
df <- USArrests

# remove missing data

# scale the data to standardize it:
df <- scale(df)
head(df)

# calculate dissimilarity by getting distances:
distance <- get_dist(df) # calculate distances
fviz_dist(distance, gradient = list(low = "#00AFBB", mid = "white", high = "#FC4E07")) # visualize by creating a dustance matrix

# K-means clustering:
# K-means algorithm can be summarized as follows:
#1. Specify the number of clusters (K) to be created (by the analyst)
#2. Select randomly k objects from the data set as the initial cluster centers or means
#3. Assigns each observation to their closest centroid, based on the Euclidean distance between the object and the centroid
#4. For each of the k clusters update the cluster centroid by calculating the new mean values of all the data points in the cluster. The centroid of a Kth cluster is a vector of length p containing the means of all variables for the observations in the kth cluster; p is the number of variables.
#5.Iteratively minimize the total within sum of square (Eq. 7). That is, iterate steps 3 and 4 until the cluster assignments stop changing or the maximum number of iterations is reached. By default, the R software uses 10 as the default value for the maximum number of iterations.

# fviz_cluster will perform principal component analysis (PCA) and plot the data points according to the first two principal components that explain the majority of the variance.

#you can also use pair-wise scatter plot to see the clustering pattern:

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2)

# Method above ^ does not provide information on the ideal number of k groups,use one of these methods:
# Elbow method
# Silhouette method
# Gap statistic

#1. Elbow method: want to determine how many clusters are needed so that the total within-cluster sum of square (wss) (which measures the compactness of the clustering) is as small as possible and does not get much smaller with more groups
# do this by calculating the wss over a range of group options (ie. 1-10) and then plot those values. Where the curve bends is the appropriate number of groups 

wss <- function(k) {
  kmeans(df, k, nstart = 10 )$tot.withinss
}

k.values <- 1:15

# extract wss for 2-15 clusters
wss_values <- map_dbl(k.values, wss)

plot(k.values, wss_values,
     type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE, 
     xlab="Number of clusters K",
     ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")

#OR better yet use this single function for elbow method:
set.seed(123)
fviz_nbclust(df, kmeans, method = "wss")

#2. Silhouette method:
#This method measure the quality of the clustering. So a high average silhouette width indicates good clustering, so when plotting this method the group that is maximized is the optimal group number for clustering:

# the long way:
## function to compute average silhouette for k clusters
avg_sil <- function(k) {
  km.res <- kmeans(df, centers = k, nstart = 25)
  ss <- silhouette(km.res$cluster, dist(df))
  mean(ss[, 3])
}

# Compute and plot wss for k = 2 to k = 15
k.values <- 2:15

# extract avg silhouette for 2-15 clusters
avg_sil_values <- map_dbl(k.values, avg_sil)

plot(k.values, avg_sil_values,
     type = "b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE, 
     xlab = "Number of clusters K",
     ylab = "Average Silhouettes")

# wrapped up into one function:
fviz_nbclust(df, kmeans, method = "silhouette") # so says 2 is the optimal number of groups, but 4 groups is a close second option

#3. Gap statistic: this approach can be applied to ANY clustering method (kmeans, hierarchical, etc.). The gap statistic compares the total intracluster variation with different values of K with their expected values under null reference distribution of the data (i.e. a distribution with no obvious clustering).
#SO: That is, for each variable  in the data set we compute its range and generate values for the n points uniformly from the interval min to max.

# compute gap statistic
set.seed(123)
gap_stat <- clusGap(df, FUN = kmeans, nstart = 25,
                    K.max = 10, B = 50)
print(gap_stat, method = "firstmax")

#We can visualize the results with fviz_gap_stat which suggests four clusters as the optimal number of clusters.

fviz_gap_stat(gap_stat) # shows that 4 clusters are the best option

# overall, the results of the 3 methods mostly point towards 4 clusters, so use that many in the analysis:

set.seed(123)
final <- kmeans(df, 4, nstart = 25)
print(final)

#visualize:
fviz_cluster(final, data = df)

# do some descriptive statistics based onthe clustering:
USArrests %>%
  mutate(Cluster = final$cluster) %>%
  group_by(Cluster) %>%
  summarise_all("mean")
